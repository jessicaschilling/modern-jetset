Shinier player for [Modern Jetset Mixcloud archive episodes](https://www.mixcloud.com/irisberkeley/playlists/modern-jetset/), available at [modernjetset.com](https://modernjetset.com).

Nothing special: grabs JSON for the last published episode from the [Mixcloud API](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/), drops details into some divs, and plops in Mixcloud's embedded player. CSS is just [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) from a CDN.

The pretty background video is from Stas Knop via [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/video/a-vinyl-record-played-on-a-turntable-4380097/). Modern Jetset logotype is bastardized italic of Matthew Carter's lovely [Elephant](https://www.linotype.com/899983/elephant-family.html).
